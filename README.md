    - added filter functions that let you delete some parts of request and
    response objects (like credentials) before saving them as fixtures
- templates
    - https://github.com/gofiber/template/tree/master/html
    - use `io.FS`
    - removed `Parse`
- signals
    - https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/tree/master/pkg/manager/signals
    - aye, removed test since they use Ginko/Gomega
- cmdline
    - https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/u-root/u-root@v0.11.0/pkg/cmdline#CmdLine.Flag
    - for parsing simple cmdline arguments in kernel style `foo=bar feature1 load-cannons=yes`
